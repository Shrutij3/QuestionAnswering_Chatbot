# QuestionAnswering_Chatbot

## 🌟 Project Overview
I’m thrilled to introduce my *Question-Answering Chatbot, an advanced AI system built using the latest tools from the **LLM ecosystem. This chatbot is designed to efficiently answer questions from documents using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- *🔗 LangChain* - For seamless LLM workflows
- *🗂️ Pinecone* - For fast and scalable vector search
- *⚡ Streamlit* - For a smooth, user-friendly interface
- *🌐 Gemini* - For extended API functionalities

## 🔍 Embeddings Model
The chatbot utilizes *sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2* for embedding generation. While this model provides a strong foundation, I plan to *fine-tune* it for enhanced accuracy and performance.

## 🎯 Key Features
- *Efficient document-based Q&A*
- *Fast retrieval using Pinecone vector search*
- *Interactive UI powered by Streamlit*
- *Robust LLM integration via LangChain*
- *Future enhancements with fine-tuned embeddings*

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
This project wouldn’t have been possible without the inspiration and guidance from:
- *Prof. Sujit Chaudhari* - Inspiring my deep dive into LLMs
- *Priyanka Lanjewar Ma’am* - Guiding my journey into Deep Learning
- *Vijaya A.* - Expert session that introduced me to RAG

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Fine-tuning the embeddings model for better accuracy
- Adding multi-document support
- Enhancing response generation with more LLM integrations

This project has been an incredible learning journey, and I’m excited to explore further innovations and optimizations! 🚀
